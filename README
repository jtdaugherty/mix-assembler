MIXAL Assembler
===============

This package provides an incomplete implementation of an assembler for
the MIXAL assembly language.  See the `language-mixal` package for the
parser for a MIXAL parser used by this assembler.  The assembler saves
binaries in its own format for later use by a disassembler and an
emulator.

To try it:

    $ cabal-dev install .../language-mixal .
    $ cabal-dev/bin/mix-as test.mixal

Check out `--help` for assembler options.
